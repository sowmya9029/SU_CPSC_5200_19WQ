# CPSC-5200-01 Software Architecture and Design Outside Reading List

This is just a list of architecture and design books that are generally useful to have on your bookshelf. Most are recent, some are starting to show their age, and some are good for their historical perspective. I'll lump them into groups, but sometimes there are interesting intersections.

Quick note: Searching Amazon by ISBN isn't always possible. Use the full title name and author to narrow down your search if the ISBN results don't make sense.

## Software Architecture Patterns and Styles

This collection covers a number of reference books for understanding the generic styles and patterns of software architecture. The POSA books comprise a reasonably thorough overview of the patterns you will run across in the wild, so the list starts with them.
